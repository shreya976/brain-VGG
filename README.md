 Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are a diverse group of primary brain tumors that often arise in young, otherwise healthy patients and generally have an indolent course with longer-term survival in comparison with high-grade gliomas.In this study , we trained model for automatic lgg brain tumor detection by fully connected convolutional neural networks. The paper presents a network and training strategy that relies on deeper U-Net architecture design . Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation paper was published in 2015. Our method was evaluated on datasets of 20 patients were obtained from TCIA, which contain 20 low-grade brain tumor cases. Cross validation has shown that our method can obtain promising segmentation efficiently.
